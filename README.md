## About This Website
This is an educational website dedicated to **Corporate Modernism**, a mid-century architectural and design movement that defined the modern corporate aesthetic. The site explores the philosophy, origins, pioneers, and iconic examples of this influential style.

## What is Corporate Modernism?
Corporate Modernism is an architectural doctrine where form is dictated by function, resulting in clean lines, unadorned surfaces, and an emphasis on industrial materials. It was the visual signature of the post-war corporate boom and continues to influence design globally.

Key characteristics include:

- **Simplicity**: Rejection of ornamentation. Buildings are simplified to their essential, geometric forms—rectangles and cubes dominate.
- **Structure**: The internal structure is often visible externally, emphasizing steel frames and the grid system of the facade.
- **Materials**: Preference for industrial, machine-made materials: glass, steel, and reinforced concrete, often appearing polished and slick.
